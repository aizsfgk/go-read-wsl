	// For example, we could choose not to run _Gscanrunnable

	// _Gwaiting means this goroutine is blocked in the runtime. /// 阻塞在运行时

	// but should be recorded somewhere
	/// 它被记录在一些地方：例如 一个channel的等待队列

	// queue) so it can be ready()d when necessary. The stack is

	// _Psyscall means a P is not running user code. It has

	// uses lightweight transitions and maintains M affinity.
	//
	// Leaving _Psyscall must be done with a CAS, either to steal
	// or retake the P. Note that there's an ABA hazard: even if
	// an M successfully CASes its original P back to _Prunning
	// after a syscall, it must understand the P may have been
	// used by another M in the interim.
	///
	/// _Psyscall 意味着 一个P没有运行用户代码。它具有亲和力对一个陷入系统调用的M,但是
	/// M并没有拥有P, P可以被其他M窃取。这是相似的如同_Pidle,但其使用轻量的转换和管理
	/// M的亲和力。
	/// P脱离_Psyscall状态必须使用CAS命令，这意味着P被窃取了，或者被先前的M重新持有。
	/// 注意：这里有个ABA的风险：好像一个M成功的执行了ABA状态转换，它原始的P变为了_Prunning
	/// 在一个系统调用之后，必须理解的是这个P可以被其他M临时使用一会儿。
	_Psyscall

	// _Pgcstop means a P is halted for STW and owned by the M
	// that stopped the world. The M that stopped the world
	// continues to use its P, even in _Pgcstop. Transitioning
	// from _Prunning to _Pgcstop causes an M to release its P and
	// park.
	//
	// The P retains its run queue and startTheWorld will restart
	// the scheduler on Ps with non-empty run queues.
	///
	/// _Pgcstop 意味着一个P被中断为了STW, 被M（已经停止了世界的)拥有。

///
// The guintptr, muintptr, and puintptr are all used to bypass write barriers. /// 用来绕过写屏障
// It is particularly important to avoid write barriers when the current P has
// been released, because the GC thinks the world is stopped, and an
// unexpected write barrier would not be synchronized with the GC,
// which can lead to a half-executed write barrier that has marked the object
// but not queued it. If the GC skips the object and completes before the
// queuing can occur, it will incorrectly free the object.
//
// We tried using special assignment functions invoked only when not
// holding a running P, but then some updates to a particular memory
// word went through write barriers and some did not. This breaks the
// write barrier shadow checking mode, and it is also scary: better to have
// a word that is completely ignored by the GC than to have one for which
// only a few updates are ignored.
//
// Gs and Ps are always reachable via true pointers in the
// allgs and allp lists or (during allocation before they reach those lists)
// from stack variables.
//
// Ms are always reachable via true pointers either from allm or
// freem. Unlike Gs and Ps we do free Ms, so it's important that
// nothing ever hold an muintptr across a safe point.

// A guintptr holds a goroutine pointer, but typed as a uintptr
// to bypass write barriers. It is used in the Gobuf goroutine state
// and in scheduling lists that are manipulated without a P.
//
// The Gobuf.g goroutine pointer is almost always updated by assembly code.
// In one of the few places it is updated by Go code - func save - it must be
// treated as a uintptr to avoid a write barrier being emitted at a bad time.
// Instead of figuring out how to emit the write barriers missing in the
// assembly manipulation, we change the type of the field to uintptr,
// so that it does not require write barriers at all.
//
// Goroutine structs are published in the allg list and never freed.
// That will keep the goroutine structs from being collected.
// There is never a time that Gobuf.g's contain the only references
// to a goroutine: the publishing of the goroutine in allg comes first.
// Goroutine pointers are also kept in non-GC-visible places like TLS,
// so I can't see them ever moving. If we did want to start moving data
// in the GC, we'd need to allocate the goroutine structs from an
// alternate arena. Using guintptr doesn't make that problem any worse.
